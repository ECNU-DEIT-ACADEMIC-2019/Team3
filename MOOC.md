#MOOC platform
**> 1.Environment**
###Platform environment
It is a supportive environment for the whole process of online learning and teaching
Environment building tools include performance tools, communication tools, student participation tools, course release tools, course management tools, hardware/software and security/performance (focus on the first five tools)
1. Performance tools: navigation and help, calendar/task, asynchronous synchronization (support download of synchronous and asynchronous learning materials, such as PPT and other materials released by teachers)
2. Communication tools: discussion forum, live broadcast by teachers (teachers can communicate with students in real time via live broadcast), and course email (email reminder will be provided when course content is released)
3. Student participation tools: self-evaluation and mutual evaluation (for example, each student must evaluate the work of 3-5 other students), student files (mainly including: video and test completion mark, simple display of course progress, test completion mark)
4. Hardware/software: server, database and browser requirements, APP and mobile service support
5. Security/performance: user login security and access speed, error prevention and reporting
Development trends:
Support learners to carry out adaptive learning according to their own learning characteristics and styles; Support the individualized and multi-mode curriculum construction of teachers; Building learning communities through social software to achieve extensive social interaction; Make full use of open education resources (OERs) and support open sharing of courses; Use a variety of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, posture computing, learning analysis, mobile terminals, to build immersive, interactive, experience-oriented, personalized learning environment.

**> 2.Knowledge,Skills,Attitude**

>>(1)Knowledge: the platform provides courses of various types and fields, and learners can choose courses according to their interests and needs

>>(2)Skills: learners acquire skills through learning different courses. For example, through learning the course of microcontroller, master the microcontroller programming and operation methods.

>>(3)Attitude: platform learning can enhance students' awareness of independent learning, information literacy and cooperative spirit.

**> 3.Behavior**
>>MOOC, known as massive open online platforms (MOOC), have a variety of behaviors that can occur on top of them.In my opinion, it can be divided into the following categories: 1.The teaching behavior of teachers on the platform2. Learning behavior of learners on MOOC platform;3. Learners' interactive behaviors on the platform;4. Learners' evaluation behavior on the platform.I will analyze these behaviors in detail.

>>1.Teachers' teaching behaviors on the platform.Teachers are the transmitter of knowledge. Teachers teach relevant course contents to learners through video teaching on the platform.Relevant course materials are uploaded to the MOOC platform for learners to preview before class or review after class.

>>2. Learning behavior of learners on the platform.Learners enter the MOOC platform through registration and choose courses they are interested in on the platform, mainly through video. Video can be suspended and the learning speed can be controlled by learners.

>>3. Learners' interactive behaviors on the platform.When learners have completed the corresponding course units, they can interact on the platform.Interaction can be divided into three types : (1) interaction between learners and teachers.Learners can send doubts and confusion points in the course learning on the platform, and the teacher will answer them. (2) interaction between learners.After learning the course, learners discuss the content of the course in the discussion section, communicate their views and places of interest with classmates in the community, and also discuss their doubts with classmates, so as to gain a deep understanding of the course.

>>4. Learners' evaluation behavior on the platform.When learning a course, learners need to complete relevant homework and unit evaluation after each class.After completing a course, you need to conduct a final assessment on the platform to determine whether you are qualified or not.

**> 4.Interaction**
Students interaction refers to how to learn, including learning methods and learning media. 
(1)the manner
>>>In this section, learning is divided into the learning of students in the individual self-learning and mixed mode and the learning media used in them.
>>>The first is personal learning, which is divided into six steps：browsing、searching、positioning、learning、assessment and class. Browsing refers to the recommendation of familiarizing with platform functions and high-score courses. Students can familiarize and recognize the platform by browsing. Then it’s the searching. If a student has a clear goal, he can use the search function to find a specific course and start learning. If a student   want to learn something based on the previous browsing, students can learn by the recommendation of the boutique or the course category set by the platform. Then, student locate the course(s), because there may be a lot of classes belong to same theme in the MOOC platform, some of the courses may have similar names, so it is necessary to select according to their course introduction, including the time and duration of the course, and the specific course content. If students are interested in some course, students can also take the first lesson. The first class will usually introduce the course in detail.  Students can know the teacher's class style. And finally determine a course by clicking the above method and click to join the course. Student can found the course in” my course”. Next, it is the most important phase——learning, including learning the course content, participating in discussions, completing and submitting assignments. The content of the course is mainly in the form of a unit-on-a-week. The course update will notice the student, and the course that has already been completed will retain the content of the previous course. Course content forms are generally in the form of videos, documents, discussions, and assignments. Watching video is the main learning method. It’s usually about 5-20 minutes. Students can pause at any time. The videos support double speed. In the discussion section, it is divided into the form of asking questions and discussions with teachers or discussing with classmates. Students can ask questions in the course discussion board by pressing the button "Question and Discussion" while watching the video. When discussing with classmates, the topic of discussion can be given by the teacher or classmates. When the homework is released, will provide the task, content and form of the homework, the exact time of completion, the form and method of submission, the requirements and standards of the evaluation. It requires personal assignments or teamwork. After the homework is uploaded. There will be three ways to evaluate including self-assessment, mutual evaluation and teacher evaluation. Finally, there is an assessment. The usual grades are divided into discussions and assignments. The final exams will be in the form of online exams or final large works. Eligible students can apply for an electronic or paper certificate if they pass the examination or give up halfway.
>>>The second is a mixed classroom. Some teachers will let students learn online and offline learning in the form of flipping classrooms. The specific learning method is decided by the course teacher.
(2)the manner
>>>The media is divided into client-side media. Students can learn by means of mobile phones, tablets, computers, etc. The media has video, audio, and electronic documents.

**> 5.Experience**

>>    Platform experience. Users' experience of the platform is mainly reflected in the design, resources and interaction of the platform. So we will display information from platform home page design, program, Learning content, and activity design, Learning resources, interaction design, registration way, charge level etc. Several aspects carries on the analysis of Chinese university MOOC platform experience, we mainly from the perspective of learners, in-depth analysis of E - Learning platform of learners experience.

>>(1)Homepage design of the platform:
    The structure of the first page of MOOC in Chinese universities is mainly composed of upper and lower boundary and boundary between courses. Learners can clearly find the target learning section in the interface. The navigation bar is tiled in a fixed position on the left side of the page and provides the navigation of the course for the learning user according to the course category. The platform has a rich search engine, which can search courses and resources through courses, schools, teachers and exam-oriented types. In addition, in the page design of this platform, when the mouse pointing to the area has obvious visual changes.
Good interface design can help learners learn conveniently on the platform, which is an important aspect of the platform to bring learners good learning experience.

>>(2) Course display information:
    We further studied the experience of the course information provided by this platform to learners. The course display information provided by this platform mainly includes: course introduction, starting time, learning duration, number of applicants, advanced knowledge, teaching objectives, syllabus, assessment standards, course chapters, lecturers, frequently asked questions, etc. Course display information is an important information for learners to refer to when choosing courses through the platform. This platform provides relatively detailed course display information. Learners can combine the information provided by the course with their own time, ability, interest and other aspects to choose courses suitable for them.
The platform should provide comprehensive course information as much as possible so that learners can understand the course more clearly and have a better choice of experience process

>>(3)Learning content and activities:
    The learning content and activities of this platform include: course announcement, learning progress, learning statistics, my grades, chapter video, assignments/tests/exams, discussions/notes, course evaluation (peer review, teacher evaluation). Learning activities are divided into many small learning tasks, which can achieve a good fragmentation of learning. Notes are taken during the course, and there are channels for communication with teachers and peers. After the course, there are timely consolidation activities. Learners can also know their own learning progress in real time and get the evaluation of the course, including the evaluation system from the perspective of teacher evaluation and peer evaluation. Complete learning content and activities enable learners to complete the overall construction of course knowledge and form a complete thinking process of learning.

>>(4)Learning resources:
    The learning resources provided by the platform include two parts: video learning resources and learning materials. Video learning resources are mainly short video taught by the course teachers. The video resources support video subtitles, speed adjustment, clarity adjustment and advance and retreat adjustment, but do not support subtitle positioning and video download functions. Study materials include presentations, outreach readings, reference materials, etc. Learning resources are important materials used by learners to assist and expand their learning. It is especially important to provide high-quality, abundant and suitable learning resources for learners, and there is still a lot of room for moocs in Chinese universities to improve learning resources.

>>(5)Interactive experience:
    The interaction design of this platform includes: the interaction in the course and the discussion board interaction. The interaction in the course includes teacher's question and answer interaction, and so on. The platform provides rich interaction in discussion areas, including all discussion areas, teacher q&a area, communication area and comprehensive discussion area. According to the classification of discussion area, the interaction between students, teachers and students is more convenient, and learners can quickly find the discussion content they want to know in the discussion area, so as to reduce information selection.
The interaction channel provided by the platform is an important way for learners to participate in the course learning. Good interaction is an important link for learners to develop multi-faceted abilities and qualities.

>>(6)Performance evaluation:
    The course grade evaluation on this platform is composed of homework, unit test, class discussion and final exam, each of which has a certain proportion. Some courses also have peer evaluation. After passing the course, the platform will provide a free electronic certificate, but no credit certificate.
Performance evaluation can play a role in diagnosis, stimulation, regulation, teaching and guidance, and guide the learning stage; The platform can provide certificates to improve learners' learning enthusiasm

>>(7)Registration method and fees:
The platform is open to the general public and can be registered or imported by the school. The platform is not only available for individual learners to learn independently, but also can be connected with school courses to realize the development of mixed learning in high line. In addition, platform courses have a large number of free high-quality resources for learners to learn, and also provide more abundant services for users with additional needs.

>>**The direction of the platform to improve user experience:**
>>(1)Platform home page presentation mode optimization
>>(2)Standardization of course guidance resources
>>(3)Diversification of course learning resources
>>(4)The richness of interactive functions of the platform

**>6.Interact object**

  Through the analysis of the platform of Chinese universities, we can analyze the interactive objects from three elements:       teachers, learners and others.
  
（1）Teachers
  
  As an online open course platform, the most important content exporter of MOOCS in Chinese universities is teachers. There are three main ways for learners to acquire knowledge from teachers. First, learners learn by watching videos taught by teachers. Video is the most important form and the characteristic of MOOCs. Secondly, teachers can know the learners' learning progress through the classroom discussion area, and answer the learners' problems. Thirdly, through the question-answering area, the teacher further elaborates and answers the unsolved questions in the classroom.
  
(2) Learners
  
  In addition to being learners, the students of the platform also play the role of problem-solver. Besides learning knowledge from eachers, they can also express their own views, answer other people's questions and act as knowledge exporters through the comprehensive discussion forum.
 
（3）Others
  
  Others here include some of the best in the industry, as well as people who are interested in a particular field. For example, Microsoft  Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses on the platform of MOOCs are not full-time teachers, but some researchers of Microsoft Asia Research Institute, which belong to the industry leader. Another example is a course of "Artificial Intelligence and Information Society" offered by Peking University. Its teachers put some materials in the comprehensive discussion area. These materials come from people who are interested in Artificial Intelligence. From this we can see that others here refer to anyone who can provide knowledge to learners except teachers and learners.
  
 **>7.Disadvantages of MOOC platform:**
 >>As a relatively large online learning platform, MOOC platform has prominent advantages, such as openness, low threshold, students can choose courses they are interested in, and students can adjust their learning progress freely.But it also has some disadvantages.The disadvantages of MOOC platform are as follow：
 
>>1.there are many MOOC courses, but the quality of some courses is difficult to guarantee.Among the many MOOCs, the quality varies.The quality of MOOCs created by different schools, teachers and makers varies.The quality of MOOCs offered by some well-known universities is high, but the quality of MOOCs in general is not.These poor quality courses do not interest students.

>>2. low credit acceptance.At present, MOOC still lacks a complete school register, degree and management system.Even though some schools recognize students' credit for studying MOOCs, most enterprises in the society are suspicious of MOOC learning and do not recognize MOOC credits.Even though most MOOC course completers can obtain the corresponding certificates, due to factors such as the imperfect examination mechanism and the lack of good reputation of certificates, the certificates issued by universities to MOOC learners are not recognized by the job market, but only regarded as a sign for learners to complete MOOC learning.

>>3. low completion rate and poor learning effect.As things stand, there is still a big problem with the completion rate of MOOCs.Pennsylvania's 2012 survey found that the average completion rate for MOOCs was just 4%.Statistics show that less than 10 percent of students who enroll in MOOC programs actually complete the course.Huang zhonghua studied students from three universities in zhejiang, zhejiang university of technology, zhejiang institute of science and technology and zhejiang foreign languages university.According to the study, only 21% of students have paid attention to MOOCs. Among those who have used MOOCs, 60% of students spend one or two hours a week on MOOCs, and participation on MOOCs is generally low.Meanwhile, according to the statistics of MOOC learning effect evaluation, 91% of students think MOOC learning effect is poor, while 5% think MOOC learning effect is average.This shows that MOOC is not effective in the classroom application of universities, and there are big problems.

>>4. authenticity of learning is difficult to guarantee.MOOCs use an online learning model, in which students complete their studies and homework online and are assessed online.In the final assessment, students only need a computer and the Internet to complete, without the invigilation of teachers, students only need to fill in the letter of good faith commitment or even do not need to fill in the examination, the authenticity of this examination method cannot be guaranteed.


 **>8.Advice:**
>>Although MOOC platform has great advantages, its disadvantages are obvious enough. How to effectively correct the disadvantages of MOOC platform is a process that needs reflection.Here are some of my personal Suggestions.

>>(1) professional production team.We should professionalize the MOOC development team, and build a MOOC construction team with teachers, experts, students and platform developers. Team members should do their part to build high-quality educational resources.At the same time, the content design of MOOC courses in Chinese universities must highlight local characteristics and increase the interest of courses.

>>(2) improve the credit management system.Degree is the foundation, while MOOC is the architecture. Only when the foundation is solid can the architecture be stable and solid, and only when the system is perfect can MOOC develop steadily.The most urgent task is to solve the problems of MOOC credit certification, online learning mode, examination and evaluation criteria.China should establish a complete system to promote the development of moocs in China and among universities.

>>(3) make the course more interesting.Enhance the interest of mooc, build a number of mooc courses with strong interest, in the course construction to increase the characteristics, so as to attract students, ensure that students continue to learn, promote students to actively and actively learn, improve the interest of students continue to learn, to ensure the quality of learning.
>>(4) improve platform infrastructure construction.Only when the infrastructure is perfect can more people learn on the platform.Only when the facilities are perfect can the real effectiveness of learning be guaranteed.
