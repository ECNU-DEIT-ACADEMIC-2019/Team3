  Through the analysis of the platform of Chinese universities, we can analyze the interactive objects from three elements:       teachers, learners and others.
  
  （1）Teachers
  
  As an online open course platform, the most important content exporter of MOOCS in Chinese universities is teachers. There are </br>three main ways for learners to acquire knowledge from teachers. First, learners learn by watching videos taught by teachers. </br>Video is the most important form and the characteristic of MOOCs. Secondly, teachers can know the learners' learning progress </br>through the classroom discussion area, and answer the learners' problems. Thirdly, through the question-answering area, the teacher </br>further elaborates and answers the unsolved questions in the classroom.
  
  (2) Learners
  
  In addition to being learners, the students of the platform also play the role of problem-solver. Besides learning knowledge from</br> teachers, they can also express their own views, answer other people's questions and act as knowledge exporters through the comprehensive </br> discussion forum.
  
  （3）Others
  
  Others here include some of the best in the industry, as well as people who are interested in a particular field. For example,</br> Microsoft  Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses on the platform of MOOCs are not full-time teachers, but some researchers of Microsoft </br>Asia Research Institute, which belong to the industry leader. Another example is a course of "Artificial Intelligence and </br>Information Society" offered by Peking University. Its teachers put some materials in the comprehensive discussion area. These </br>materials come from people who are interested in Artificial Intelligence. From this we can see that others here refer to anyone </br>who can provide knowledge to learners except teachers and learners.
