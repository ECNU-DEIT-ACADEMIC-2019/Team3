**> 1.Environment**

**> 2.Knowledge,Skills,Attitude**

>>(1)Knowledge: the platform provides courses of various types and fields, and learners can choose courses according to their interests and needs

>>(2)Skills: learners acquire skills through learning different courses. For example, through learning the course of microcontroller, master the microcontroller programming and operation methods.

>>(3)Attitude: platform learning can enhance students' awareness of independent learning, information literacy and cooperative spirit.

**> 5.Experience**

>>    Platform experience. Users' experience of the platform is mainly reflected in the design, resources and interaction of the platform. So we will display information from platform home page design, program, Learning content, and activity design, Learning resources, interaction design, registration way, charge level etc. Several aspects carries on the analysis of Chinese university MOOC platform experience, we mainly from the perspective of learners, in-depth analysis of E - Learning platform of learners experience.

>>(1)Homepage design of the platform:
    The structure of the first page of MOOC in Chinese universities is mainly composed of upper and lower boundary and boundary between courses. Learners can clearly find the target learning section in the interface. The navigation bar is tiled in a fixed position on the left side of the page and provides the navigation of the course for the learning user according to the course category. The platform has a rich search engine, which can search courses and resources through courses, schools, teachers and exam-oriented types. In addition, in the page design of this platform, when the mouse pointing to the area has obvious visual changes.
Good interface design can help learners learn conveniently on the platform, which is an important aspect of the platform to bring learners good learning experience.

>>(2) Course display information:
    We further studied the experience of the course information provided by this platform to learners. The course display information provided by this platform mainly includes: course introduction, starting time, learning duration, number of applicants, advanced knowledge, teaching objectives, syllabus, assessment standards, course chapters, lecturers, frequently asked questions, etc. Course display information is an important information for learners to refer to when choosing courses through the platform. This platform provides relatively detailed course display information. Learners can combine the information provided by the course with their own time, ability, interest and other aspects to choose courses suitable for them.
The platform should provide comprehensive course information as much as possible so that learners can understand the course more clearly and have a better choice of experience process

>>(3)Learning content and activities:
    The learning content and activities of this platform include: course announcement, learning progress, learning statistics, my grades, chapter video, assignments/tests/exams, discussions/notes, course evaluation (peer review, teacher evaluation). Learning activities are divided into many small learning tasks, which can achieve a good fragmentation of learning. Notes are taken during the course, and there are channels for communication with teachers and peers. After the course, there are timely consolidation activities. Learners can also know their own learning progress in real time and get the evaluation of the course, including the evaluation system from the perspective of teacher evaluation and peer evaluation. Complete learning content and activities enable learners to complete the overall construction of course knowledge and form a complete thinking process of learning.

>>(4)Learning resources:
    The learning resources provided by the platform include two parts: video learning resources and learning materials. Video learning resources are mainly short video taught by the course teachers. The video resources support video subtitles, speed adjustment, clarity adjustment and advance and retreat adjustment, but do not support subtitle positioning and video download functions. Study materials include presentations, outreach readings, reference materials, etc. Learning resources are important materials used by learners to assist and expand their learning. It is especially important to provide high-quality, abundant and suitable learning resources for learners, and there is still a lot of room for moocs in Chinese universities to improve learning resources.

>>(5)Interactive experience:
    The interaction design of this platform includes: the interaction in the course and the discussion board interaction. The interaction in the course includes teacher's question and answer interaction, and so on. The platform provides rich interaction in discussion areas, including all discussion areas, teacher q&a area, communication area and comprehensive discussion area. According to the classification of discussion area, the interaction between students, teachers and students is more convenient, and learners can quickly find the discussion content they want to know in the discussion area, so as to reduce information selection.
The interaction channel provided by the platform is an important way for learners to participate in the course learning. Good interaction is an important link for learners to develop multi-faceted abilities and qualities.

>>(6)Performance evaluation:
    The course grade evaluation on this platform is composed of homework, unit test, class discussion and final exam, each of which has a certain proportion. Some courses also have peer evaluation. After passing the course, the platform will provide a free electronic certificate, but no credit certificate.
Performance evaluation can play a role in diagnosis, stimulation, regulation, teaching and guidance, and guide the learning stage; The platform can provide certificates to improve learners' learning enthusiasm

>>(7)Registration method and fees:
The platform is open to the general public and can be registered or imported by the school. The platform is not only available for individual learners to learn independently, but also can be connected with school courses to realize the development of mixed learning in high line. In addition, platform courses have a large number of free high-quality resources for learners to learn, and also provide more abundant services for users with additional needs.

>>**The direction of the platform to improve user experience:**
>>(1)Platform home page presentation mode optimization
>>(2)Standardization of course guidance resources
>>(3)Diversification of course learning resources
>>(4)The richness of interactive functions of the platform

>6.Interact object

  Through the analysis of the platform of Chinese universities, we can analyze the interactive objects from three elements:       teachers, learners and others.
  
（1）Teachers
  
  As an online open course platform, the most important content exporter of MOOCS in Chinese universities is teachers. There are three main ways for learners to acquire knowledge from teachers. First, learners learn by watching videos taught by teachers. Video is the most important form and the characteristic of MOOCs. Secondly, teachers can know the learners' learning progress through the classroom discussion area, and answer the learners' problems. Thirdly, through the question-answering area, the teacher further elaborates and answers the unsolved questions in the classroom.
  
(2) Learners
  
  In addition to being learners, the students of the platform also play the role of problem-solver. Besides learning knowledge from eachers, they can also express their own views, answer other people's questions and act as knowledge exporters through the comprehensive discussion forum.
 
（3）Others
  
  Others here include some of the best in the industry, as well as people who are interested in a particular field. For example, Microsoft  Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses on the platform of MOOCs are not full-time teachers, but some researchers of Microsoft Asia Research Institute, which belong to the industry leader. Another example is a course of "Artificial Intelligence and Information Society" offered by Peking University. Its teachers put some materials in the comprehensive discussion area. These materials come from people who are interested in Artificial Intelligence. From this we can see that others here refer to anyone who can provide knowledge to learners except teachers and learners.
