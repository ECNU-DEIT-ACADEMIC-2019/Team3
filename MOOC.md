  Through the analysis of the platform of Chinese universities, we can analyze the interactive objects from three elements:       teachers, learners and others.
  
 ##（1）Teachers
  
  As an online open course platform, the most important content exporter of MOOCS in Chinese universities is teachers. There are three main ways for learners to acquire knowledge from teachers. First, learners learn by watching videos taught by teachers. Video is the most important form and the characteristic of MOOCs. Secondly, teachers can know the learners' learning progress through the classroom discussion area, and answer the learners' problems. Thirdly, through the question-answering area, the teacher further elaborates and answers the unsolved questions in the classroom.
  
 ##(2) Learners
  
  In addition to being learners, the students of the platform also play the role of problem-solver. Besides learning knowledge from eachers, they can also express their own views, answer other people's questions and act as knowledge exporters through the comprehensive discussion forum.
  
 ##（3）Others
  
  Others here include some of the best in the industry, as well as people who are interested in a particular field. For example, Microsoft  Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses on the platform of MOOCs are not full-time teachers, but some researchers of Microsoft Asia Research Institute, which belong to the industry leader. Another example is a course of "Artificial Intelligence and Information Society" offered by Peking University. Its teachers put some materials in the comprehensive discussion area. These materials come from people who are interested in Artificial Intelligence. From this we can see that others here refer to anyone who can provide knowledge to learners except teachers and learners.
